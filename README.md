# Campus Connect
An Android app that lets college students create, manage and subscribe to communities.

While signing up, the app does not differentiate between a member and an administrator. This is because every user can use the app with either role, depending on the community under discussion. Users can search for the communities they are already a part of in the real world, and subscribe to them. We have also added a private community option, in case the administrator wants to verify the identity of the subscriber before he/she can subscribe to the community. Users get the updates of their subscribed communities in their home screen – all in one place. They can also visit a particular community to view the updates of that particular community.
Updates can be in the form of posts containing text and images, or in the form of events, which contain field’s specific to an event – such as date, time and location. 
Users can also start their own communities from within the same app, and begin to publish posts and events right away.
